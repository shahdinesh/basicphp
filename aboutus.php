The term 'Patan' derives its name from the five basic human values; truth, right conduct, peace, love and non-violence. In fact, these values are the essences of human spirituality.

They are capable enough to give the students the best education in their fields of study. Here every one is genuinely open, friendly and helpful, making students' academic pursuit more enjoyable and goal-oriented. The life of a student here is fun-filled, academically vibrant but creative and blossoming. Patan discourages conventional approaches to teaching and embraces pragmatic and productive method. As a result, the learning teaching experience here is much more active and participatory. Students learn to apply their knowledge to practical and professional values.<br /><br />

The college has got a prominent location in close proximity to Ring Road at Tinkune that is to say, the meeting point of  three adjoining districts of the valley. The premises thus are within an easy reach for students coming from different corners. Equipped with state of the art resources and amenities, it is no less on a par with international institutes. Because of these exemplary features, the college turns to be a genuinely ideal center of education characterized by its stimulating and supportive environment.
